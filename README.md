# SnakeLadder
The Snake and Ladder game is a classic board game that is popular worldwide. In this game, players roll dice and move their game piece along a board that is marked with a grid of squares. The board is usually divided into a grid of 100 squares, with some of the squares being marked with snakes or ladders.

The goal of the game is to reach the last square of the board, which is usually marked with a "100". The players start at square 1 and roll a dice to determine how many squares to move their game piece forward. If the game piece lands on a square with a ladder, the player's game piece is moved up to a higher numbered square. If the game piece lands on a square with a snake, the player's game piece is moved down to a lower numbered square. The player who reaches the last square first wins the game.

The project is an implementation of the Snake and Ladder game using JavaFX. The project consists of four main classes: SnakeLadder, Board, Dice, and Tile.
